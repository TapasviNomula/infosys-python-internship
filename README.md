# üìò Infosys Virtual Internship
## Python Programming to Git Workflow

This repository has been created as part of my **Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship**.  
It demonstrates my **learning outcomes** in Python programming and showcases how these concepts are integrated with **Git version control** for professional project management.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Build a strong foundation in **Python programming**.
- Apply coding skills to solve practical problems.
- Write **clean, well-documented code** with comments and readable structure.
- Gain hands-on experience with **Git** for collaboration and version control.

---

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- **`Infosys_Workbook.ipynb`** ‚Äî A guided notebook from Python basics to Git:
  - Data types, operators, strings, lists, sets, dicts
  - Conditionals, loops, functions, file handling, exceptions
  - OOP fundamentals
  - Intro to data preprocessing/EDA (demonstration)
  - Git workflow basics

- **`Assignments_Notebook.ipynb`** ‚Äî All core Python programs in one place, with clear explanations and outputs.

- **`assignments/`** ‚Äî Standalone `.py` scripts for each program (easy to run individually).

- **`Outputs_Reference.md`** ‚Äî Sample outputs for quick verification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3**, **Jupyter Notebook** / **VS Code** / **Google Colab**
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
### Notebook (recommended)
Open `Infosys_Workbook.ipynb` or `Assignments_Notebook.ipynb` in **Jupyter**, **VS Code (Jupyter extension)**, or **Google Colab** and run cells top-to-bottom.
